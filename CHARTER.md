# Implementation Horizontal Committee
This Horizontal Committee will provide umbrella governance over the implementability of an extension. This will include, but not limited to, providing oversight for DoD POCs, ensuring we have a cost/benefit tradeoff for instructions including Power/Performance/Area and ROI, fostering development and documentation of best practices for extension implementation,  coordinating implementation interactions between extensions, and provide signoff at milestones as per the DoD. It is expected that most of the business of this HC will be done via representatives working on the TGs doing the extensions and bringing appropriate discussions, actions, and status to the HC as appropriate. The group will get together in a meeting rarely either to discuss strategy to accomplish it's charter and if needed to discuss issues with a particular extension.
